pyIBM - An Immersed Boundary Method Python code
===============================================

*Updated: May 8th, 2014*

Currently, pyIBM runs only on Unix systems. It is not supported on Windows

We recommend setting the environment variable `PYIBM_DIR` to point to the location of the pyIBM folder, since some of the validation scripts provided make use of it. For a `bash` shell, add the following line to the file `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

	export PYIBM_DIR=/path/to/pyibm/folder

Reload the file:

	> source ~/.bashrc
